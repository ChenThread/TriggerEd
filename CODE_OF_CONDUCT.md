# Code of conduct

As an engineer, I spend a lot of my time solving problems. I loathe it when people decide to create problems and then pile even more problems on top of them to render them unsolveable. Therefore, I am preemptively solving the problem of people causing problems by creating this code of conduct instead to prevent said people from even trying to cause their problems here.

* Leave your political agenda at the door
* Bonus points if you put it in the bin
* Extra bonus points if you throw it into a volcano instead

If you don't agree with it, please direct your attention away from this project and [onto this music which is probably more up your alley.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4)
